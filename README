NAME
    Test::NoSmartComments - Make sure no Smart::Comments escape into the
    wild

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.005 of Test::NoSmartComments -
    released December 02, 2014 as part of Test-NoSmartComments.

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::More;
        eval "use Test::NoSmartComments";
        plan skip_all => 'Test::NoSmartComments required for checking comment IQ'
            if $@ ;

        no_smart_comments_in;
        done_testing;

DESCRIPTION
    Smart::Comments are great. However, letting smart comments escape into
    the wilds of the CPAN is just dumb.

    This package provides a simple way to test for smart comments _before_
    they get away!

FUNCTIONS
  no_smart_comments_in($file)
    Called with a file name, this function scans it for the use of the
    Smart::Comments module.

  no_smart_comments_in_all
    no_smart_comments_in_all() scans the MANIFEST for all matching
    qr!^lib/.*.pm$! and issues a pass or fail for each.

  no_smart_comments_in_tests
    Like no_smart_comments_in_all(), we scan the MANIFEST for all files
    matching qr!^lib/.*.t$! and issues a pass or fail for each.
